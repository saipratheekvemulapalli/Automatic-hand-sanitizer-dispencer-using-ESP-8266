# Automatic-hand-sanitizer-dispencer-using-ESP-8266
Corona Virus (Covid19) is wreaking havoc in the world. In this project, I have build an Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser with an LCD which also shows the temperature of the user. If the temperature of the user is above 99 degree Fahernit, the LCD will recommend the user to get tested for Covid and display nearby hospitals for the user to get  tested. An ultra sonic sensor is used to check the presence of hands below the outlet of the sanitizer machine. It will continuously calculate the distance between the sanitizer outlet and itself and tells the ESP to turn on the pump whenever the distance is less than 15cm to push the sanitizer out
